1. True

2. 98%,9sec,9MB

3. Accuracy is an optimizing metric; running time and memory size are a satisficing metrics.

4. 9,500,000  250,000  250,000

5. False

6. The test set no longer reflects the distribution of data (security cameras) you most care about.
   
   This would cause the dev and test set distributions to become different. This is a bad idea because you’re not aiming where you want to hit.

7. 

8. 0.3%(accuracy of expert #1)

9. A learning algorithm’s performance can be better than human-level performance but it can never be better than Bayes error.

10. Train a bigger model to try to do better on the training set.

    Try decreasing regularization.

11. You should try to get a bigger dev set.

    You have overfit to the dev set.

12. If the test set is big enough for the 0.05% error estimate to be accurate, this implies Bayes error is \leq 0.05%≤0.05

    With only 0.09% further progress to make, you should quickly be able to close the remaining gap to 0%

    It is now harder to measure avoidable bias, thus progress will be slower going forward.
 
13. Rethink the appropriate metric for this task, and ask your team to tune to the new metric.

14. Use the data you have to define a new evaluation metric (using a new dev/test set) taking into account the new species, and use that to drive further progress for your team.

15. If 100,000,000 examples is enough to build a good enough Cat detector, you might be better of training with just 10,000,000 examples to gain a \approx≈10x improvement in how quickly you can run experiments, even if each model performs a bit worse because it’s trained on less data.

    Needing two weeks to train will limit the speed at which you can iterate.
